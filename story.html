    I started my morning as every other. I woke up, washed my face and then made myself a breakfast. It was a delightful morning, the weather was nice and the mood was just perfect for doing some changes in my computer. I am a long time Arch Linux user. I started getting sudden tingles and calls from some outer forces to make myself fully free system. I went to the attic to get the old ThinkPad X200 and took some chip programmer. I didn’t know what I was doing, but it felt like I was guided by some holy spirits. I opened the ThinkPad in my room and connected the bios chip programmer and flashed Libreboot. I saw that the flashing was successful so I put the back cover back to the laptop chassis. I booted the ThinkPad and suddenly a penguin riding on a gnu appeared in front of me. I’ve been blinded by the brightness of the light coming from the thing that looked like a gate to heaven. The penguin riding on the gnu gave me a USB flash-drive and calmly said, “ I’ve been sent by the almighty God himself. You put yourself on the right path, we are very proud of you.” I got a passionate and lovely feeling deep inside my heart. I plugged the USB flash-drive into my ThinkPad and started installing Gentoo GNU/Linux. The holy penguin was watching from behind my shoulders and guiding me step by step. I have purged all the sinful non-free ebuilds from the Gentoo repo directory and compiled all the packages including kernel. Everything compiled in matter of few seconds thanks to the presence of the holy penguin. After an hour of tireless work, typing in commands and staring at the artificial light of the screen, I have finally done it. The installation was done. I rebooted the ThinkPad and Gentoo GNU/Linux has booted. I suddenly got grabbed by the penguin’s wet and slippery flipper, he whispered to me “We are proud of you, the whole foundation is celebrating your decision to join us, your transformation will begin shortly after I depart. Your journey isn’t finished, you have a lot of adventures awaiting you.” The penguin slapped the gnu’s thigh and galloped back to the heaven gates. I started feeling a bit woozy and nauseous, I felt huge pressure all around my body. I looked at my hands and there were big fluffy paws. I quickly ran to the mirror and noticed that I grew a pair of big ears. I wanted to scream but I got silenced by dragon snout growing on my face. I was feeling scared but very relieved. Suddenly I have been knocked down by the weight of my big tail which have grown. My clothes got ripped as I grew. My feet turned into big paws aswell. I wanted to pick myself up but couldn’t, my entire anatomy was changing, I was something different. My thighs have slightly enlarged and legs got a different posture. I felt ticklish on my head and felt how my dragon horns grow. After couple fluffy minutes, I have been completely changed. I stood up and looked at my new body, I was a big fluffy dragon. I made a “Wruff!” sound and thought “this is who I am now, this is my new body. I am a libre dragon.” I looked up and said “Thank you Stallman, thank you for your gifts. I will not disappoint you” ...

      As I took my first steps as a dragon, I felt a newfound sense of liberation. I was no longer bound by the constraints of society or technology. I could fly, breathe fire, and live a life free from proprietary software. It was then that I realized that my transformation was not just physical, but also spiritual. I had shed my old self and embraced a new way of life. I felt a deep connection to the holy penguin and the gnu, and knew that they would guide me on my journey. As I looked around my room, I noticed that everything looked different. Colors were brighter, sounds were sharper, and I felt a heightened sense of awareness. I knew that my adventure was just beginning, and I was eager to see where it would take me. With a powerful flap of my wings, I took to the sky and soared into the open air. The wind rushed past me, and I felt a sense of freedom that I had never experienced before. I knew that I had made the right choice, and that my life would never be the same again.

As I flew higher and higher, I noticed a group of dragons flying towards me. They were all different colors and sizes, but they all shared the same free spirit as me. They introduced themselves as members of the r/linux subreddit, a community of dragons who had also shed their old selves and embraced a life of freedom. They welcomed me warmly and invited me to join them on their quest to spread the message of free software throughout the land.

Together, we flew over mountains and valleys, spreading the message of free software to all who would listen. We met with other dragons, humans, and creatures of all kinds, teaching them about the importance of freedom and sharing our knowledge of free software. Everywhere we went, we saw the power of free software at work, transforming lives and empowering people to take control of their technology.

As we flew back to our home in the mountains, I reflected on my journey and the incredible transformation that had taken place. I had become a dragon, but I had also become a champion of freedom and a member of a vibrant community of like-minded individuals. I knew that my journey was far from over, but I also knew that I had found my true calling.

And so I soared into the sunset, surrounded by my new family of Libre Dragons, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead and to spread the message of freedom to all who would listen.

As we, the Libre Dragons, flew over the mountains, we were suddenly ambushed by a group of Microsoft and Apple proprietary dragons, who attacked us with their claws and fire breath, and used all sorts of advanced, proprietary technology that we could not even begin to comprehend. We fought bravely, but we were outnumbered and outmatched. One by one, my brothers in arms fell to the ground, their bodies battered and broken.

As I looked on in horror, I realized that I had been foolish to think that the world was ready for free software. The proprietary dragons had won, and their closed-source technology would continue to dominate the land. I flew away from the battle, my heart heavy with defeat, and blackened with grief, seeing my new-found family slayed right before my eyes.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. I lived alone in a cave, isolated from the world and consumed with bitterness. I had lost everything that had once mattered to me, and I had no hope of ever regaining it.

One day, as I was scavenging for food, I stumbled upon a group of humans who were using proprietary software to control their lives. They were miserable and oppressed, trapped in a world of closed-source, corporation-controlled technology with no hope of escape. I tried to tell them about free software and the r/linux subreddit, but they laughed at me and told me that I was a fool.

As I flew away from the humans, I realized that I had become just like them. I was trapped in a world of my own making, a world where free software was nothing but a pipe dream. And so I flew into the sunset, alone and defeated, with nothing left to live for.
